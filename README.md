## Featured Projects

### 1) Hospital Admissions â€” MPR 
**Tech:** Excel 
**What I did:** Cleaned and anonymized 2 years of admissions data; produced KPIs (CSI, LOS, readmission rates, bed occupancy), time-series decomposition of admissions, and an interactive dashboard to explore departments and seasonal patterns.  
**Impact:** Identified opportunities to reduce average length of stay by improving discharge planning.

**Tech:** Excel, Power BI , Python
**What I did:** Merged procurement, payroll and billing datasets to calculate direct cost to turnover and operating profit margins by department. Built visualizations and recommendations to streamline supplier contracts. Compared differnt SBUs to determine profitability across board.

**Tech:**  Pandas , Excel
**What I did:** Built a prototype model to flag patients at high risk of 30-day readmission using EHR-derived features.
